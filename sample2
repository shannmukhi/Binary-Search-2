Firstly we will verify if the array is rotated 
If it is rotated we will first look for the pivot element
Now we perform binary search in one of the two sub arrays and retreive the elemnt less than mid 
now we perform binary search in other sub part as well and compare it to th existing minimum element
If we find then minimum is updated else remains the same
